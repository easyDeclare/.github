# easyDeclare

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **easyDeclare** — a visual notation for declarative process modeling, designed to improve understandability and reduce cognitive load compared to traditional [Declare](https://www.win.tue.nl/declare/) notation.

This organization hosts all the tools, and resources associated with easyDeclare, as described in our research paper:

> *G. Blasilli, L. S. Ferro, S. Lenti, F. M. Maggi, A. Marrella, and T. Catarci*. 
Improving the Understandability of Declarative Process Discovery Results Using easyDeclare.
*Information Systems, 2026*.

## About easyDeclare

**easyDeclare** builds on the declarative process modeling language [Declare](https://www.win.tue.nl/declare/) and proposes a new graphical notation designed according to the *Physics of Notations (PoN)* principles by Moody.
The notation has been validated through expert interviews and controlled experiments. The *easyDeclare Designer (EDD)* tool enables direct modeling using this notation.

Find out more about easyDeclare in our [research paper](https://github.com/easyDeclare/paper-artifacts/blob/main/EasyDeclare__Camera_Ready_.pdf).
